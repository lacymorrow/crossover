Other crosshair programs offer a single style or color option, and often don't allow you to reposition them. CrossOver is a small, unintrusive crosshair overlay which has plenty of configuration options to assist with aiming and vision of your crosshair. CrossOver offers a huge improvement to many games' default crosshairs for those with colorblindness or contrast issues.

###### _Thanks to Reddit user /u/IrisFlame for the premade library of crosshairs!_

# Install

_macOS 10.10+, Linux, and Windows 7+ are supported._

#### Download the latest version of CrossOver from the [releases page](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/releases/latest)

##### _Because this app is Free and Open-Source, we cannot afford to sign our code. This means Chrome may warn about an untrusted download, this is normal. Click the arrow icon -> `Keep` to finish downloading. Windows Defender and Mac Gatekeeper will prevent you from running the app the first time._


##### Windows

[**Download**](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/releases/latest/download/CrossOver.exe) the `.exe` file. _**(CrossOver-Setup-x.x.x.exe)**_

> Windows protected your PC.

- Click `More Info`
- Click `Run Anyway`


##### Mac

[**Download**](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/releases/latest) the `.dmg` file. _**(CrossOver-x.x.x.dmg)**_

> "CrossOver" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.

- Locate the `CrossOver` app
- Hold Control while you click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu

> "CrossOver is damaged and can't be opened..."

M1 Mac security fix: (_thanks [Yoyopizzacat, #207](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/207#issuecomment-1212708790)_)

- Make sure CrossOver is in your `/Applications` folder
- Open your terminal and type `sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/CrossOver.app`

##### Linux

[**Download**](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/releases/latest) the file appropriate to your system. (`.AppImage`, `.apk`, `.deb`, `.freebsd`, `.pacman`, `.rpm`, `.snap`)

_The AppImage needs to be [made executable](http://discourse.appimage.org/t/how-to-make-an-appimage-executable/80) after download._

_Certain lightweight desktop environments may require a compositor to allow CrossOver to work correctly ([#230](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/230))._

# Usage

> ❌ marks the spot…

**Position:** Click and drag the crosshair to anywhere on any screen. Double-click the bullseye to center the app.

**Choose Crosshair:** Click the bullseye ◎ to select from tons of preloaded crosshairs. Drag an image to the window to use your own custom crosshair.

**Customize** settings using the "gear" icon. _See [Settings](#settings) below._

**Unlock the app to quit** using <kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>X</kbd>, then click the close icon in the top-left corner. In Windows you can right-click on the crosshair window > `Close`.

## Settings

##### Crosshair

Choose from over 100 real and fictional crosshairs, or use your own by dragging an image to the window. You can change the size and opacity.

##### Reticle

The reticle is the small dot or cross at the center of the sight. You can select the shape and the color, or this can be turned off.

##### Hide on ADS

Choose a mouse button to use as your ADS button. The crosshair will be hidden while this button is held down.

##### Harware acceleration

A handful of users have reported FPS issues with certain games ([#70](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/70)), CrossOver should not add any FPS or latency so if you experience it, toggle this setting on or off and disable [`Hide on ADS`](#hide-on-ads)

##### Start on boot

You can automatically set CrossOver to start when your system starts on your gaming PC, so you're always ready to pop heads.

##### Automatic Updates

By default CrossOver will automatically keep itself updated with bug fixes and improvements. You can disable this in the settings to prevent all network requests.
CrossOver will _only_ connect to GitHub to download published releases and does not send or store _any_ personal data. I'm a solo developer and you aren't important to me 🙂 I just want to game.

#### Keybinds

> See [default keyboard shortcuts](#default-keyboard-shortcuts).
> All of the keybinds can be changed or disabled except for the bind to reset all settings. Click into the input and press your bind, or press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd> to disable a bind.

Keep in mind that keybinds may conflict with other programs so be careful about what you choose. There's no real mechanism for preventing you from setting two conflicting keyinds within the app, so don't do that.

##### Duplicate crosshairs

Duplicate crosshair windows use the same settings as the main window and do not support all of the features of the main window. Settings for duplicate crosshairs will not be saved and all duplicate windows will be closed if the main window is closed. Duplicate crosshairs cannot follow the mouse.

##### Reset

To reset all settings and binds to default, press <kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>R</kbd>

###### Newer MacOS' may quarantine the `CrossOver.app` package. To un-quarantine:

- Move `CrossOver.app` to your `Applications` folder
- Open terminal and type: sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/CrossOver.app

# Development

Built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org). Simple HTML and Javascript, no framework.

Start developing in `src/main.js` and `src/renderer.js`. `index.html` contains the layout and `index.scss` contains the styles for the main app [`BrowserWindow`]()

### Run

##### _You will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.x.x installed. If you have `nvm` installed, run `nvm install && nvm use` to switch to the correct node version._

```
$ yarn && yarn start
```

### Build

> Build steps optimized for Mac, see [electron.builder](http://electron.builder) for help customizing builds.

_wine_ and _mono_ must be installed for Windows builds _(macOS)_
[_multipass_](https://multipass.run/) must be installed for Snap builds _(macOS)_

```
$ yarn build
```

> Or `yarn build:all`

### Publish

```
$ yarn release
```

Then edit the automatically created GitHub Releases draft and publish.

## Bugs

### [Hidden by fullscreen apps](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/1)

Currently CrossOver only works with windowed applications, use `Windowed Fullscreen` mode if your game or application supports it. _Windows_ -

Fullscreen for MacOS may have better results.

#### Workaround

If you absolutely need to use `Fullscreen` mode, or your game is not supported by crossover, there is a workaround using [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

_Doesn't work with some games [#47](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/47#issuecomment-895995990), and causes FPS issues in other cases_

Install AutoHotKey and run this script with it (save it as `script.ahk` and double-click it):

```autohotkey
Home::Winset, Alwaysontop, , CrossOver
```

Once in-game, pressing space should put the crosshair over the screen, even in fullscreen mode.

### Graphical issues on Linux

Check your desktop environment. CrossOver may not work on KDE, try GNOME if you experience issues.

CrossOver behaves weirdly if your desktop is missing a compositor ([#230](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/230)). Try installing one to see if that resolves the issue.

### Hidden by fullscreen apps on Linux

Some compositors, such as KDE Plasma's KWin, can't keep a window (CrossOver) over a full-screen window, so in such cases another compositor needs to be run that has this option.

GNOME's Mutter is one of those compositors that can do this.

In Lutris, for example, this can be automated with shell scripts that will run when the game is launched and quit.

Lutris->Right click on game's banner->Configure->System options:

`Pre-launch script`: /path/to/x.sh

```shell
#!/bin/bash
mutter --replace # or: gnome-shell --replace
```

`Post-launch script`: /path/to/x.sh

```shell
#!/bin/bash
kwin_x11 --replace
plasmashell --replace
```

## Debugging

You can run CrossOver from the command line to see debug output. Open a terminal and navigate to the CrossOver app, run `./CrossOver` to see output:

> (Mac, Linux)
```sh
╭─  lacymorrow in /Applications/CrossOver.app/Contents/MacOS using
╰─○ $ ./CrossOver --debug
09:45:16.023 › CrossOver 2.7.4 Development
09:45:16.030 › Setting: Enable GPU
09:45:16.487 › App ready
```

### Command-line lags

#### `--debug`

_alias_ `-d`

Start CrossOver in debug mode, with Chrome DevTools open.

#### `--reset`

_alias_ `-r`

Reset all app preferences to default, in case you get into a broken state.

#### `--version`

_alias_ `-v`

Print the app version to `stdout` (Good for CI).
