Other crosshair programs offer a single style or color option, and often don't allow you to reposition them. CrossOver is a small, unintrusive crosshair overlay which has plenty of configuration options to assist with aiming and vision of your crosshair. CrossOver offers a huge improvement to many games' default crosshairs for those with colorblindness or contrast issues.

###### _Thanks to Reddit user /u/IrisFlame for the premade library of crosshairs!_

## Development

Built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org). Simple HTML and Javascript, no framework.

Start developing in `src/main.js` and `src/renderer.js`. `index.html` contains the layout and `index.scss` contains the styles for the main app [`BrowserWindow`]()

### Run

_You will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.4.X installed. If you have `nvm` installed, run `nvm use` to switch to the correct node version._

```
$ yarn && yarn start
```

### Build

> Build steps optimized for Mac, see [electron.builder](http://electron.builder) for help customizing builds.

_wine_ and _mono_ must be installed for Windows builds _(macOS)_
[_multipass_](https://multipass.run/) must be installed for Snap builds _(macOS)_

```
$ yarn build
```

> Or `yarn build:release`


### Publish

```
$ yarn run release
```

Then edit the automatically created GitHub Releases draft and publish.


## Bugs

### [Hidden by fullscreen apps](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/1)

Currently CrossOver only works with windowed applications, use `Windowed Fullscreen` mode if your game or application supports it. _Windows_ -

#### Workaround

If you absolutely need to use `Fullscreen` mode, or your game is not supported by crossover, there is a workaround using [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

Install AutoHotKey and run this script with it (save it as `script.ahk` and double-click it):

```autohotkey
space::Winset, Alwaysontop, , CrossOver
```

Once in-game, pressing space should put the crosshair over the screen, even in fullscreen mode.
